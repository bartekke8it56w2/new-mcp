# Model Context Protocol with Gemini Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation creates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Google's Gemini API to provide analytical thinking capabilities without code generation. The server follows the MCP standard and leverages Gemini's advanced reasoning capabilities to analyze problems, especially in the context of codebases.

## Architecture

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. **GeminiThinkingServer** - Core class that manages communication with Gemini API and processes thoughts
2. **MCP Server** - Standard MCP server implementation that handles tool requests
3. **Tool Definition** - Definition of the "geminithinking" tool with its schema
4. **Client Examples** - Sample clients that demonstrate how to use the server

### Component Details

#### GeminiThinkingServer

This class is responsible for:
- Managing the session with Gemini API
- Validating and processing thought data
- Formatting thoughts for display
- Extracting meta-information from Gemini responses
- Maintaining thought history and branches
- Saving and loading analysis sessions

#### MCP Server

The server implements the Model Context Protocol standard:
- Handles tool listing requests
- Processes tool call requests
- Manages the connection with clients via stdio transport

#### Tool Definition

The "geminithinking" tool is defined with:
- Comprehensive description of capabilities
- Input schema with required and optional parameters
- Support for various thinking patterns (sequential, branching, revision)
- Session management commands

#### Client Examples

Multiple client examples demonstrate:
- Basic usage with simple queries
- Codebase analysis with filtering
- Interactive exploration of alternative paths
- Session persistence and management
- Advanced semantic filtering of codebases

## Key Features

1. **Gemini-Powered Thinking**
   - Leverages Gemini's analytical capabilities
   - Prevents code generation (focuses on analysis only)
   - Configurable generation parameters

2. **Meta-Commentary System**
   - Provides insights into the reasoning process
   - Includes confidence levels for generated thoughts
   - Suggests alternative approaches

3. **Thought Management**
   - Sequential thinking with adjustable total thoughts
   - Branching to explore alternative paths
   - Revision of previous thoughts

4. **Codebase Integration**
   - Support for analyzing code repositories
   - Basic and advanced filtering of relevant parts of the codebase
   - Semantic-based code filtering using keywords and relevance scoring
   - Automatic extraction of keywords from queries
   - Context-aware analysis

5. **Visualization**
   - Formatted output with clear thought boundaries
   - Color-coded thought types (regular, revision, branch)
   - Display of meta-information

6. **Session Persistence**
   - Save analysis sessions to files
   - Load sessions to resume analysis
   - Query current session state
   - Manage multiple analysis sessions
